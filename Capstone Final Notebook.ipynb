    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "The goal of my project was to determine if I could classify which users of a depression forum, would eventually become suicidal, based on the words that they used when describing their depression. I began by scraping [takethislife.com](https://www.takethislife.com) a website that contains forums that provide support to those dealing with suicidal or depressive feelings. I scraped both the depression and suicide forum for the text of the posts and the usernames along with some other metrics I felt would help identify users as suicidal or not. By using NLP I hoped to learn what words were indicative of the difference in the way the two groups speak. I hope that one day research on the topic will advance enough to allow us to diagnose serious mental illness well in advance and help patients seek help before they become a threat to themselves.\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Unfortunately, the numbers of depression are on the rise. According to [this](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/major-depression-among-adults.shtml) study by the NIH, nearly 7 percent of US adults, and over ten percent of those between the ages of 18-25, have had a major depressive episode in the last year. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db76.htm) less than one-third of Americans taking one antidepressant medication and less than one-half of those taking multiple antidepressants have seen a mental health professional in the past year. The internet has become a tremendous source of people reaching out for help. Having all this public data gives us a tremendous opportunity to study this population and try to understand what factors put someone at risk.\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "I began the predictive part of my project by labeling my data. I took all of the depressive data and labeled each post with a one or zero indicating if that poster had also posted in the suicide forum or not. The analysis was done using Natural Language Processing and TFIDF, which scores the words on how rarely they appear in all of our text, which means that the word would potentially have more meaning than a word that is frequently said. It is great for comparing how different groups use different words. I built several different models to see which of those would end up doing the best at predicting suicide. The two that performed the best were SVC with a linear kernel and logistic regression. I grid searched the best parameters for these two models and ultimately went with logistic regression , it had a roc-auc score of .78, the recall or true positive rate for the suicidal class was .72 , this means that 72 percent of the time that a user was, in fact, suicidal or not. Since I wanted to maximize my model correct guesses of people who were suicidal even at the risk of misclassifying some other users I created another model where I weighted or increased the probability of predicting suicide as higher. With this method, I was able to get my model's recall up to 83 . This obviously comes at a cost of telling people who are not suicidal that they are, which is something that I wanted to minimize, I therefore limited the extent to which I weighted my model, even though medical studies will often weight their classes quite heavily in order to catch all of the true positive occurrences.\n",
    "### Findings \n",
    "While I can't go through each of the nearly ten thousand words that remained in our text after I cleaned it, I want to share some words from each class that I thought were interesting and indicative of each group. Some of the words that strongly indicated suicide were, 'idk' possibly indicating a feeling of being lost, 'mean', 'pain', 'peace', 'cutting', 'no longer', 'survive', 'loser', 'tired', 'don't deserve', 'cold', 'watched', 'music', 'hallucination', 'sinking', 'sexual abuse', 'the hospital', 'bible','schizophrenia','doing drug' and 'invisible'. Some of the words associated with depression were 'I'm selfish', 'he loved me', 'therapy', 'cycle of', 'my ex', she told me that she', 'and watch tv', 'friends', 'feel uncomfortable/down', 'hope for the future', 'diagnoses', 'dog', 'divorced', 'single', 'not suicidal', 'university', 'sober', and 'in a rut'.\n",
    "### Conclusion \n",
    "The fairly high success rate at which my model was able to accurately predict suicide indicates that there is, in fact, a difference in the way the two groups speak. The words attributed to each class and the clearly different stories that each one tells indicates this as well. These words can also be used for informal inference in the way in which we try to help those that are suffering from depression, for example people who used the word 'dog' were 40 percent more likely to fall into the depression class, which makes sense but is something people would probably rarely think of as an actual \"treatment\".\n",
    "### Moving Forward \n",
    "While the words that I chose above were indicative of a very specific story I was trying to tell, the full list of nearly ten thousand words was, in fact, a bit messy, with some overlap between the classes. I think that they could be largely cleaned up by using an industry specific stop words list to remove words that are confusing the model, as well as a modern day texting/abreviation stop words. Another option I would explore would be to tag my text based on whether it is a specific part of speech, say a noun or verb, to see if the different groups actually describe their circumstances differently. Obviously, the more data we have the better we can train our model to understand what we want, sites like Reddit also contain large forums dedicated to depression and suicide that can be explored as well. Last but certainly not least I would love to get my model into a deployable form so it can be used **by those who understand the industry** as an aid. This project was an incredible experience to work on and I hope that future data can help improve it and save lives.\n",
